            "content": "Beginners Guide to FastAi Chapter 1 and 2 . Welcome to the world of Deep Learning. Let me tell you a quick overview of myself, I come from an Engineering backgroud and currently working in a well renowed MNO in India. While doing my regular job, one day I got this feeling to learn something new though my current job also offers me to learn everyday. I however, being a TV series fanatic got curious about the recommendations being provided by OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon etc. and it came to my notice that various Deep Learning algorithms are at place to give us such suggestions. It got me motivated and here I am, the journey has started. This course was referred to me by one of my friend/mentor who is a pioneer in Data Science working with nVidia. . Lets start with the problems that I faced till Chapter2 of the book and their solutions. I will try to provide the exact links where you can refer to the solutions. . The Chapter1 of the book gives an overview of the authors of the book, Deep Learning, the softwares to be used for deep learning. . As it is was completely new for me, I had no idea how to open the notebooks which kept me thinking for a while. So the first task is to open the book in Jupyter Notebooks. I would recommend to use Paperspace Gradient which is easy to setup. . Setup Guide Link: https://course.fast.ai/start_gradient . The thing that I liked about this course is the teaching method that uses top down approach. I had never came across such teaching method and as I am going past the course, it seems quite interesting. . Once you are able to open the book in Gradient, you can run the cells and the output will be visible. The Image Recognizor is the firse code that we are taught. Keep going through the cells and at last we will get the result predicting the images correctly. . PS.: Always remember to import the first line of codes from the notebook . !pip install -Uqq fastbook import fastbook fastbook.setup_book() . from fastbook import * . One the model is up and running, it can be used to tackle other tasks other than image recognition. . The second chapter teaches us to take the model to production, i.e, a live working app. Yes, you heard me right. We can have our app to classify and recognize images. . Follow all the codes within the notebook until you are asked to add your notebook to the github. This can be time consuming as you might be using git hub for the first time. I am sharing the post link where you can refer to setup guide. . Follow the link below to add notebook to git and deploy it: . https://forums.fast.ai/t/deploying-your-notebook-as-an-app-under-10-minutes/70621 . Remember to download your export.pkl and jupyter notebook from Paperspace gradient. . You might face issue in importing export.pkl file on git as the file size is greater than 25 MB. The method to do so is mentioned in above link. . Thats it, deploy your model using Binder and the first assignment is completed. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
